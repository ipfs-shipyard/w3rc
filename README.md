# A Web3 Retrieval Client

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/made%20by-Protocol%20Labs-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://protocol.ai)

> An experimental retrieval client for web3 content.

This client attempts to delegate the content routing problem, using a delegated content routing interface like the one provided by [storetheindex](https://github.com/filecoin-project/storetheindex). It then will attempt to provide as simple as possible retrieval of discovered content, focusing on simplicity over optimality.
